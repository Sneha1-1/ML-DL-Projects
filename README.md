## The Repository contains below projects:  

### 1. Competition- Home Credit Default Risk

Description : Using the various past credit history and other data of a client an automated process needs to be setup to give loans to the eligible candidates who have no or lower risk to default on payments. The metric used is AUC score.

Language : Python

Environment : Jupyter notebook

### 2. Bank Credit Card Defaulter Prediction

Description : The banks with the intent of credit card were more focused on the number of customers using their credit service but the drawback of them not being able to pay back the credit in time was an issue that soon followed, a system was in need to effectively decide the credit limit to be allowed to a person based on his previous credit history

Language : Python

Environment : Jupyter notebook

### 3. Loan Defaulter Prediction

Description : Whenever an individual/corporation applies for a loan from a bank, their credit history undergoes a rigorous check to ensure that whether they are capable enough to pay off the loan. We have to build a model to automate this process of loan defaulter prediction to help decide whether to issue the loan to the individual or corporation.

Language : Python

Environment : Jupyter notebook

### 4. Handwriting Recognition

Description: From the given IAMDataset which consists of images of handwritten words. Our task is to automate the process of recognising each word from the image file using deep learning.

Language : Python

Environment : Colab Notebook
